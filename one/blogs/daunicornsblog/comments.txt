README is Nice and concise

Very cool design and cool colours

In the README, I think you should have included how you were going to accomplish your what. I think you should include a breakdown of what pages you will have and information about them, how they will be played out, etc

Maybe consider having just one css file since they are all in the same file path, and it is confusing to read more than one

Should have class=“bouh” because it’s bad practice to to have more than one id tag.

Also all bouh’s have the same unique class, so this could be tidied up

What is the point of the function slide()?

It is unclear what you are trying to do in blog.js, perhaps consider having notes next to each function explaining what it does

Blog posts should link to top of page, instead of reloading to index.html
